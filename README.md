# Maru-Funkin

Hi everyone! This is a silly little Funkin 0.2.7.1 fork that ive been working on for some time now.<br>
Theres no specific goal with it, just to add whatever comes to mind and have fun!<br>
At the moment all of base game is softcoded, as well as having mod folders support.<br>
Current version is beta 2.0, beta 3.0 soon to come!

> [!NOTE]
> THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS ENGINE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING!!<br>
> For your own sanity use better engines like psych, codename or fps+
